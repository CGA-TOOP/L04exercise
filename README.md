# Homework # 1 - Operators, Expressions, Constants, and Data Types (including File IO)
## Overview
This assignment is worth 20 points. Full Collaboration is authorized however all work must be your own and you must understand everything submitted.  

## Before you Start
Ensure that you have read the lessons on [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)

## Procedures
### [Structure of a Program](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/program_structure/) Write the basic outline of a C++ Program (2pts)
Write a prgoram that prints `Hello,TOOP!`. You may choose to use explicit scope qualifications or a declaration.
### [Variables and types](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/variables/) Initialize a few variables for later on (3 pts)
Declare the following variables
- A string called `name`. This is the name of the user.
- An integer call `age`. This is the age in whole number years of the user.
- A double call `decimalAge`. This is a decimal value representing how old the use is in portions of a year.  For example, if I were 19 years and three months old, I would be 19.25 years old.
### [Basic input and ouptut](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/) Request and store some input from the user (10 pts)
You will initialize the variables you just created with the user's response.
- Request a user's full name (first and last) and store it in `name`
  >**Note**
  >you might not want to use cin for this!
- Request a user's age and store it in `age`.
- Request the number of months since the user's last birthday.  You will then initialize `decimalAge` to the proper value.
  >**Note**
  >It may be helpful to use intermediary variables to assist in the calculations.
- You will then print a summary to the user of the information entered.  Your output shoudl model the response shown below:
```
Hello, TOOP!
Please enter your name: George P Burdell
Please enter your age in years: 94
Please enter the number of monthis since your last birthday: 7
Your name is George P Burdell, and you are 94.5833 years old!
```
### [IO with files](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/) We want to keep a record of who has used our program (for posterity's sake!). (5 pts)
- To do this, we will keep a record of all users' names and decimal ages in a file called `history.txt`.  This file will be maintained in teh local directory
>**Note**
> You will wabt to append data!
- Each line should be formatted `[name]:[decimalAge]`
